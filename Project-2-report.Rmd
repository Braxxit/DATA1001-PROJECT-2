## Initial Data Analysis (IDA)



### Source

The data used in this report was collected from university students from 3/28/24 to 4/14/24 through the usage of Google Forms:
<br>
(https://forms.gle/xxXj6JNymotvkEot5)

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Shows barplot of ages of survey participants
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
Responses = read_csv("./Project 2 responses - Sheet1.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
Responses = filter(Responses, Age < 30)
ggplot(Responses) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = Age), bins=30) +
  labs(y = "Count")
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = Responses$Age) 

```

### Structure

We received 31 responses for our survey. Each row represents a survey response while each of the columns represent our variables. This survey contained both quantitative (Hours of sleep, Screen time, Phone before bed) and qualitative (Exercise, Time of medication) variables. 

### Limitations

Not everyone has a fixed sleeping schedule. It is quite likely that our survey participants had fluctuating hours of sleep throughout their weeks. This could be due to their differing school timetables, causing them to sleep and wake up at varying times.

### Assumptions
We assume that all survey participants will tell the truth and will take the survey seriously. Any illogical responses (i.e. age of participant being 999 years old) will not be included in our results.
